- [x] The documentation is professional.

### JavaScript requirements

- [x] Followed list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

- Implemented a basic UI with plain HTML:
- Created a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
- Created a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
- Created a function to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the [array filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method).
- Display all books saved in the collection in the top part of the page.
- when a user clicks the "Add" button:
  - A new book is added to the collection.
  - The new book is displayed in the page.
- when a user clicks the "Remove" button:
  - The correct book is removed from the collection.
  - The correct book disappears from the page.
- Data is preserved in the browser's memory by using [localStorage](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/local_storage.md).
- Used only plain JavaScript.
